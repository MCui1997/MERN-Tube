# MERN Tube

## Description

An online streaming service similar to YouTube! This project utilizes the MERN Stack and creates a streaming service environment that utilizes gifs and stickers for reactionary features as opposed to comments. This allows users to maintain involvement with videos but takes out the toxicity and conflict in the horror known as the YouTUBE comment section. It uses the Giphy API for gifs and stickers and all data is saved using MongoDB.
